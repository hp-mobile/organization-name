Hi, I'm Jonathan Rehm (<jrehm@mhighpoint.com>) a developer with [with HighPoint Technology](https://www.mhighpoint.com).

I would like to rename our current organization – `hp-mobile` – to `highpoint` and when I went to do so, I found that you have the name already. I noticed that you do not have much activity on Github. Would you be willing to relinquish the name so that we can use it?

Please email me and let me know.

Thank you!
